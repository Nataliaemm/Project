# Project: Mask Detection and Face Recognition

## Mask Detection on Static Images

### Project Description

This project, developed in 2021 during my master's studies, uses OpenCV and TensorFlow for mask detection on static images, showcasing skills in Deep Learning and Computer Vision.

### Update (Updated Year 2023)

The project has been updated to the latest library versions. The Jupyter Notebook here serves as a CV presentation for mask detection on static images.

#### Notes

For brevity, necessary files and dependencies are not included due to space constraints. They will be available in a separate repository.

**Note:** Refer to the [new repository](link_do_nowego_repozytorium) for ongoing development and access to all required files.

## Face Recognition and Blob Detection

### Details

Expanding on the project, we implement face recognition and blob detection using OpenCV and pretrained models. Testing will feature the dean's office staff images from the university's website.

### Future Development

The Jupyter Notebook provided is part of an ongoing project. For updates and access to all files, refer to the [new repository](link_do_nowego_repozytorium).
