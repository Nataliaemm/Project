# Project: Face mask detection system

### Project Description

The provided Jupyter Notebook serves as a link in my CV, showcasing my project on mask detection.

This project, developed in 2021 during my master's studies, uses OpenCV and TensorFlow for mask detection on static images, showcasing skills in Deep Learning and Computer Vision.

### Update (Updated Year 2023)

The project has been updated to the latest library versions. 

#### Notes

For brevity, necessary files and dependencies are not included. They will be available in a separate repository.

**Note:** Refer to the [new repository](https://github.com/Nataliaemm/In_progress) for ongoing development and access to all required files.

### Details

#### Face Recognition and Blob Detection

Expanding on the project, we implement face recognition and blob detection using OpenCV and pretrained models. Testing will feature the dean's office staff images from the university's website.
